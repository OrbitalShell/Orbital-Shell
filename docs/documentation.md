Writting theses pages, I had in mind that this project is a nice adventure, as much that it is fun to design and code a new shell, from scratch, without any code paste, ever heavyness architectural, playing with advanced C# syntactic effects, but always remembering that the fundamentals of the command line shell for me are issued from the **bash** (Bourne Again Shell) command for *Linux* (and the related uses inherited from POSIX), providing a particular mind of spirit to all this stuff. According to this, a clear philosophy was installed, and therefore is a reference guide for any work done about this project: let's this project be fun, making it possible to experiment a lot of features, as programmatic ones or functional ones, with the hapiness to build a powerfull tool that *"try to go beyond the known boundaries of the scripting world"*.

## Welcome to the project
The project activity can be split in three main parts that are dependents and complementary:
* developing the **"kernel"** of Orbital Shell to improve its capabilities, for example intervening on components like the command line parser, the command processor, data handling and processing, the console toolkit, output decorators, ...
* developing nice and powerfull **commands** that will be integrated in Orbital Shell modules and shared among each others
* developing some usages of Orbital Shell **Scripting** powerfull features, upon **batches**, **functions** and **commands**
