_The short story behind making of this theme._

This theme is developed as a learning experience.
Since there are no good bootstrap based themes for jekyll.
So I took up this opportunity to create a bootstrap based, github pages
compatible jekyll theme.

The knowledge to develop this theme is borrowed from the below two popular jekyll themes:

- [Minimal Mistakes][5]
- [Webjeda Cards][6]

## <i class="fas fa-balance-scale"></i><span class="ml-1">License</span>

Released under [MIT license][8] it is flexible for open source and commercial
uses.

## <i class="far fa-handshake"></i><span class="ml-1">Credits</span>

- [Bootstrap][1]
- [Bootswatch][2]
- [Font Awesome][3]
- [Pexels][4]
- [Minimal Mistakes][5]
- [Webjeda Cards][6]
- [animate.css][7]
